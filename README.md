## Game Play
This game loosely follows the board concept and rules of game play, so understanding these can be helpful in building your strategy. For more on the classic game instructions, visit https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-us/instruction/classic-parcheesi-game.

In your starting region, you'll need to find five frangipani flowers to offer your regional gate's shrine in order to begin your path home. 
The items you collect before you start out on the board will help you cross through the levels at different rates. On each level, items can be collected to offer for further passage. The next level you land on depends on the value of the offering. If you land in a level where there is another player, you may face a blow from your opponent to send you back to start. If you win, you can continue your journey. There are a total of 12 safe zones that break up the levels. A region's starting zone and stairway entrance level will have markets where you can barter for items you might need for your journey.


### Strategies
#### Classic Die
Once you've found the five frangipani and offered them at the gate, the player can immediately begin the game in order to closely emulate the classic die rolling experience. Item dropping is random on the game tiers, so you will move through in a "roll-based" fashion. However, other players appearing is also random, so your chance of being sent back to start are as if you are up against 12 other pawns.

#### Safe and Sound
You can plan a strategy based on what you are able to find in your starting region and safe zones. Certain neutral levels contain markets where you can ensure you find what you need to make your way with exact numbers. You can parry being sent back to start by equipping yourself with the right resources.

#### Ultimate Race Home
Combine these two strategies in order to find high counts of items and make it home fast. As item dropping and opponent spwaning is random, there is both an aspect of planning and luck in this strategy. Do you have what it takes to make it home first of your group?
